# TowerDefense

A 2D sidescrolling tower defense game built with SDL and Tiled Map Editor. Builds off of [Limeoats's Cavestory Remake](https://github.com/Limeoats/cavestory-development).

Image below links to a full playthrough of the game.

According to [This article from Gamasutra](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LarsDoucet/20140923/226261/Optimizing_Tower_Defense_for_FOCUS_and_THINKING__Defenders_Quest.php), this game violates almost every principal of a well-designed tower defense game. Oh well - this project was for practicing C++ OOP, not game design.
